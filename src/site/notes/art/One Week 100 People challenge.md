This year I participated in OneWeek100People, a challenge organised by urban sketchers [Liz Steel](https://www.lizsteel.com/) and [Marc Taro Holmes](https://citizensketcher.com/) for the first week of every March. The idea is to sketch roughly 20 people a day for 5 days, or to at least sketch more people than you would otherwise. I don't usually sketch many people, so this low bar option felt achievable.

The weekend before I went to Sculptures by the Sea at Cottesloe Beach, and whilst sketching people from life is a bit beyond me, I took enough photos of the crowds to have plenty of subjects to draw 100 people from. Drawing teeny tiny people off in the distance was its own challenge, but a useful skill to learn.

For most of my people I used my new favourite [[Fountain pens\|fountain pen]], a Sailor Fude de Mannen, which has a strangely bent nib that gives amazing line variation. I used my fountain pens with coloured ink to fill in the space with closer sketches of myself and the kids.

During the week I also did some [[art/Life drawing in different media\|Life drawing in different media]] which I feel counts, even if all the drawings were of one person in different poses. I'm not sure I hit 100 people in total, but it's certainly far more than I'd usually draw.

This last painting was done after #OneWeek100People, and I definitely felt a difference drawing a scene with lots of people in it. Usually I'll omit people in my paintings of buildings or landscapes, and even feel a bit annoyed that they're blocking a clear view. But here I feel like the vague figures give a sense of scale to the architecture, and more accurately capture the memory of the busy day.
