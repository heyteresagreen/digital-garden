Here's what I'm up to right now:

Finally finished reading [The Neuroscience of You](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/_/hQJMEAAAQBAJ?hl=en) by Chantel Prat, and realising (again) that right before I sleep is not the best time for me to read non-fiction (here's the [[books/Books I've read in 2024\|Books I've read in 2024]] so far). Working in [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbooks]] #5 (watercolour, A5) and #6 (mixed media, A6) concurrently and going through the live version of Liz Steel's Watercolour course. Playing around with making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Teresa_Watts), just for fun. I now have a [working RSS feed ](https://teresawatts.com/feed.xml)thanks to [Noel](https://noeldemartin.com/)!

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
