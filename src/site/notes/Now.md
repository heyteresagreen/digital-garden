Here's what I'm up to right now:

Reading [The Neuroscience of You](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/_/hQJMEAAAQBAJ?hl=en) by Chantel Prat, I keep getting distracted by other books (here's the [[books/Books I've read in 2023\|Books I've read in 2023]] so far). Onto my fourth sketchbook for the year (here's my [[sketchbooks/Sketchbook 1\|Sketchbook 1]] and [[sketchbooks/Sketchbook 2\|Sketchbook 2]]), and have been procrastinating the last few assignments of Liz Steel's [Foundations](https://sketchingnow.com/foundations2023/) class. I've gone deep down a stationery nerd rabbit hole so far resulting in a fancy leather notebook cover which Iâ€™m so far loving, and coveting a larger collection of fountain pens. So far on my most successful run of [Morning Pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) yet, which admittedly was previously at 3 days (now about 16).

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
