This 4 night birthday trip to Bali is the most prolific trip I have been on in terms of sketching! Itâ€™s in part because I went with friends and without kids, but it also helped to have a paired down travel sketching kit.

I always bring too much, but day to day this is what I had with me this time:
* A very slim, pocket sized sketchbook that I made myself. It has just 9 spreads so very light and portable.
* A Sailor Fude pen with permanent black ink, for line work.
* My [[Tiny watercolour kit v2\|Tiny watercolour kit v2]] with some updated watercolour paints, now I can fit more in there.
* A Sakura Koi travel water brush.
* A cut down microfiber cloth.

All of this fit easily into my Uniqlo sling bag, along with my water bottle and camera. It was nice to have something to work on in downtime throughout the day, and I feel the difference between the pages where I was able to get a quick sketch down en plein air versus ones where I worked entirely from photos. They're rough but lively!

There's a flick through of my sketchbook at the end of the video above, and you can also see photos of the spreads in [[sketchbooks/Sketchbook 12\|Sketchbook 12]].
