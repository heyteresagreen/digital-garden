Here's what I'm up to right now:

### December 2025
Doing some [[notes/Digital Gardening\|Digital Gardening]] maintenance - I have over a hundred random thoughts and quotes in my digital note taking system, which I'm trying to process into a more [[notes/Evergreen notes\|Evergreen notes]] form and better integrate into my existing collection of notes. I'm slowly starting to post a collection of these here on this site, although as they are personal notes they might not make much sense to anyone else!

In a fit of nostalgia I bought myself a "retro" handheld gaming device - a New Nintendo 2DS XL - at an exorbitant price probably driven by other nostalgic adults wanting to revisit some old beloved games. I'm picturing myself spending the lazy days between Christmas and New Years playing Pokémon and Professor Layton, but it's more likely the kids will take it off me.

### November 2025
Still [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|reading at lot]], [[Art\|painting a little]], mostly at life drawing. I bought a secondhand scooter (a push one, not electric) to ride with my kids and I’m still learning how to turn without falling off. Trying to save some of the best hours of the day for myself (I’m not greedy, I don’t need to keep *all* of them for myself). Enjoying the greenery in my courtyard now that I’ve established a few hardy, water-wise plants that haven’t died despite my neglect.

### June 2025

Playing around with sewing and crocheting clothing - nothing fancy or particularly polished, but it’s satisfying being able to fill a need by just making it myself. Making my spaces cosy and well-lit for winter. Not writing much because I’m struggling to bring myself to look at a computer screen once the work day is done.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it when I remember, which usually ends up being when I send a [[Letters\|newsletter]].
