![IMG_0231 1.jpeg|Sketchnote from PWAC 2025](/img/user/assets/IMG_0231%201.jpeg)

Another great [Perth Web Accessibility Camp](http://www.a11yperth.com/events/perth-web-accessibility-camp-2025.php)!

This is the first time I tried doing one large sketchnote with bits from each talk, rather than a large one each. It's very dense but looks kind of cool as a whole, and takes a bit less energy out of my to produce.
