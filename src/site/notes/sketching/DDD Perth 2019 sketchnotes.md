<p><a href="https://dddperth.com/" target="_blank">DDD Perth</a> is one of my favourite conferences, so having a young baby in tow wasn&#8217;t going to stop me from attending &#8211; and sketchnoting. I wasn&#8217;t able to get all of it, but being prepared meant that these are some of the nicest sketchnotes I&#8217;ve done!</p>
<p>Some things I did to make sure I was set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>went over the program in detail and decided which talks to attend</li>
<li>set up a colour palette and my brush set that I use for sketchnotes</li>
<li>made a new file for each talk in Procreate with the header and footer set up </li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up in advance meant that I could spend more time doing little portraits of each speaker based on their bio pics, rather than scrambling during the talk or having to remember afterwards. </p>
