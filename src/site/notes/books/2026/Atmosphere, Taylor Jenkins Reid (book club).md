Set in the 1980s, a cohort of astronauts in training includes some of the first women to go into space. Also there's a love story.

I do enjoy science fiction, and had just read a book about astronauts to my 6 year old, so I felt pretty ready going into this book. There's quite a tonal shift going from the science-heavy beginning as main character Joan starts her astronaut training, to the love story unfolding, to the boring middle bit, and then to the final chapters where a whole lot of stuff happens all at once. There are dual timelines, which can be a bit confusing if you're not paying attention. There are touches on the sexism that women, and particularly queer women, faced in such a male-dominated space in the 1980s.

I thought it was good but didn't feel completely cohesive. It made me want to reread Andy Weir books like *The Martian* and *Project Hail Mary* for more space nerdery, and also *This Is How You Lose the Time War* for another queer love story.
