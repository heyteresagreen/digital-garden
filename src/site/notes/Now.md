Here's what I'm up to right now:

Still [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|reading at lot]], [[Art\|painting a little]], mostly at life drawing. I bought a secondhand scooter (a push one, not electric) to ride with my kids and I’m still learning how to turn without falling off. Trying to save some of the best hours of the day for myself (I’m not greedy, I don’t need to keep *all* of them for myself). Enjoying the greenery in my courtyard now that I’ve established a few hardy, water-wise plants that haven’t died despite my neglect.

### June 2025

Playing around with sewing and crocheting clothing - nothing fancy or particularly polished, but it’s satisfying being able to fill a need by just making it myself. Making my spaces cosy and well-lit for winter. Not writing much because I’m struggling to bring myself to look at a computer screen once the work day is done. [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|Reading books]]. Painting a little.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it when I remember, which usually ends up being when I send a [[Letters\|newsletter]].
