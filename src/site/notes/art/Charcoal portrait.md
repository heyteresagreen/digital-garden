I'm always amazed about how quickly a charcoal sketch can come together... and how quickly it can be smudged if you touch it wrong! I thought I was finished with this one after just a few sessions, but came back to it after a break to deepen the shadows and get the nose just right. Reference photo and direction from Stephanie Sheppard.

*Beginnings, at Steph's studio - crazy eyes and eyebrows!*

*At home, I tape the paper to my courtyard door in place of a vertical easel. Blocking in shadows roughly here.*

*After I thought I was finished, I did a study focusing on just the nose and realised I could push my full portrait further*

*Deeper shadows and smoother transitions after some more work*
