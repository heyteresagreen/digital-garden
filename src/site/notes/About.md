I'm an artist and designer interested in exploring how technology can help rather than harm, thinking through writing, and the power of observation expressed through traditional art media. 

I have over 20 years of experience working on digital products, websites, apps and brands, and am currently a Lead UX Designer at [Moodle HQ](http://moodle.com). 

[[Art\|Art]] has been part of my life pretty much forever in one form or another, and my drawing skills and creative approach inform my UX design work through [[Sketching\|sketchnotes]], little illustrations and workshops.

From 2026 I’ll have a little availability for interesting projects outside of my usual work and art. If you have something super exciting in mind, [let’s chat](mailto:teresawatts@gmail.com)!
### Some cool things I’ve done:

* Run an in-person workshop with more than 40 participants at the Moodle Moot Australia 2025 conference. It’s been some time since I’ve done something like that IRL and it has a completely different vibe to completely remote workshops done digitally.
* Run another in-person workshop at the UX Camp Perth 2025 unconference, teaching participants how to “see like an artist”, observe more deeply, and draw portraits. 
* Working with the other Experience Design Leads at Moodle, I designed a fair and creative recruitment process for new positions in our team. Can a job interview with design tasks be a great experience? Yes! I managed the hiring process and interviews for 3 UX design roles, all three fantastic additions to the team.
* Reskinned the user account management interface for MoodleCloud to fit with the current brand, improve accessibility and provide a seamless experience going from the website, to signup, to managing your account. I got myself knee-deep in Google Analytics, writing front-end code and trying to understand Git. I’ll probably stay in my lane more next time, but I’m as proud of having my code in production as I am of the vast improvement in how it looks (and sounds if you’re using a screen reader!)
* Reinvented our Experience Design team sharing/critique sessions for higher engagement, better quality feedback, and all-round good team culture vibes.
* Painted a huge mural on the wall of an ice-cream shop. It was a long time ago and it’s gone now, but I will hold onto that experience forever.
