I’ve been making some simple clothing that I haven’t been able to find easily in shops. So far I’ve been sticking to linen and trying to make some matching sets that can also be mixed in with my other clothes. It’s so satisfying to make something to fill a gap in my wardrobe, even if the construction is a little on the dodgy side as I’m learning.

I’ll add more in here as I make more things.

[DIY Trapezoid Skirt Tutorial — DIY Daisy](https://www.diydaisy.com/blog/trapezoid-skirt)
These two skirt patterns are very similar but give slightly different silhouettes. I love the look of the flat front waistband, which could also easily be used with the trapezoid shape rather than the rectangle. I have 3 skirts in different prints/colours, but a simple black linen skirts with pockets has been one of the favourite things I’ve made.

I’ve made the jacket version of this top in two different linens, and they make a great lightweight cover when in the sun, or a thin extra layer when it’s slightly cold.
