There's something kind of cool about having all your artwork together in a book. Even if individually each page is not amazing, collectively they tell a story and show skills evolving over time.

I've gone back to keeping physical sketchbooks since the start of 2023, and I'll be numbering them on a rolling basis rather than tied to the year.
