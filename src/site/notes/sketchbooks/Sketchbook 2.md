I started this sketchbook at the end of June 2023, and currently it's still in progress.

After completing [Sketchbook 1](sketchbooks/Sketchbook%201.md), I decided to lean further into exploring watercolor and learning sketching fundamentals. This time I bought a watercolor sketchbook (Seawhite of Brighton) with nice thick paper and a hard cover. The difference in how watercolor layers on this paper versus the 90gsm Rhodia paper is huge, but the extra expense and weight is also making me pause before picking it up as often. I have a sense of not wanting to "waste" it, although of course a sketchbook sitting unused is surely more of a waste.

I've also been doing Liz Steel's Foundations course, which means most of my pages at the moment are doing the assignments which vary from testing materials to whole watercolor paintings done on location (I haven't managed many of these!).

Here's some spreads so far:
