# Books I've read in 2025
This year I'm trying something a little different - writing a few notes for each book I finish, in an effort to try and remember things better.

## In progress

### Animal Farm, George Orwell

### Designing You Life (2016), Bill Burnett & Dave Evans

### This is How You Lose the Time War, Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone

Two combatants on opposite sides in a war amongst time travellers slowly build up a relationship over cleverly hidden letters they leave for each other. Incredibly poetic, I felt like rather than trying to make sense of every sentence I should just let it wash over me. Iâ€™ve never read prose anything like it before. Thank you for lending it to me Sandy!

### Spider-Man: Animals Assemble! and Spider-Man: Quantum Quest!, Mike Maihack

I don't usually put the books I read to my kids in here, but this made-for-kids graphic novel series is actually really good! The stories are silly and fun, and the art style is cute but still has its recognisable Western comic roots. It's clear a lot of thought was put into how to make it easy for an adult to read to a child, not an easy thing with a graphic novel. I'll always appreciate the way Spider-Man's mask eyes make expressions as if they were actual eyes, a comic effect that just doesn't make sense in a live action movie. More comics for me this year I think!

### The Nightingale, Kristin Hannah (book club)

This historical fiction story follows a pair of estranged sisters living in occupied France during World War II. I don't often read books about war, but when I do it's usually stories about the people left behind rather than the ones on the frontlines. There's some romance threads in this one but they're outshined by the beautifully complicated family relationships. I think all the characters started out unlikeable but grow over the course of the book. Starts slow but the second half escalates quickly!

<div>

### The Name of the Wind, Patrick Rothfuss

This epic fantasy novel started out strong for me with its premise of the main character, Kvothe, telling the story of his start in learning magic and music to a collector of stories. The magic system is unique and there are some intriguing characters, but towards the end it dragged on and did not make me feel up to tackling the next book in the series anytime soon.

### Orwell's Roses (2021), Rebecca Solnit

For some reason I was expecting fiction rather than a collection of meandering essays following George Orwell's interest in gardening and how it relates to his writing, his politics, and the state of the world then and now. Beautifully written with each chapter weaving in from the previous ones. Makes me want to revisit Orwell's novels and pay some more attention to my poor garden.
