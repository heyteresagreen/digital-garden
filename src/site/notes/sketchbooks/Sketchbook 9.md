I started this sketchbook in May 2024 and completed it in August 2024. It had just 20 pages, and the paper was a bit light for wet media, but ok for light watercolour washes and gouache.

📖 Traveler’s Journal sketchbook insert
🎨 Daniel Smith watercolours, Winsor & Newton gouache
✏️ Prismacolor Premier pencils, Derwent Rebel watercolour pencils
✒️ Lamy Safari, Kaweco Sport, Sailor Fude de Manen
...plus other random materials
