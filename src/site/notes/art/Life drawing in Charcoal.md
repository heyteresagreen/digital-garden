After struggling a bit with [[art/Life drawing in watercolour\|Life drawing in watercolour]] recently, I’ve returned to charcoal. It’s nice to not have to worry about mixing colours or having enough watercolour paper. It’s been a while since I’ve done the longer poses in charcoal, and I feel like I’ve come a long way over this year of regular life drawing sessions - I’m no longer afraid to work larger, go darker, include faces (sometimes).
