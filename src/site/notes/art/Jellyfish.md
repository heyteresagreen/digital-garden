![digital painting of two jellyfish](/img/user/assets/jellyfish.jpeg)

I've been mostly sketching traditionally lately, so here's my first go back at digital painting for 2023.

Painted in [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) using the [Perfect Oils](https://creativemarket.com/Ldarro/6441075-Perfect-OILS-87-brushes-4PROCREATE) brush set, mainly IMPASTO 3.0 Fechine's Expressive #1 which does some lovely mixing.
