Recently I've been doing 1 on 1 art classes with [Stephanie Sheppard](https://www.stephaniesheppard.net.au/),  after going to a couple of her group workshops focused on portraits. This pencil portrait of Sabrina from a reference photo was my first assignment, which I completed over a 2 week period. 

Because I usually work quite small and quick in little [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbooks]], this was a massive challenge! A couple of hours in I had a powerful urge to stop and call it done, although the point of this assignment and what I asked for was to push myself further in detail and realism. I'm glad I overcame it and kept going, because this is one of the best things I've ever made.

I came across Sabrina again, modelling for [[art/Life drawing in Charcoal\|life drawing]], always a pleasure to draw.
