![self portrait - 1.jpeg|self portrait on a pink background|700](/img/user/assets/self%20portrait%20-%201.jpeg)

Trying to use up some dried up gouache from my palette. Because I painted the background first, it’s overall a bit pinker and darker than I would have liked. Not quite a great likeness, but closer than I’ve gotten in other self portraits.
