Here's what I'm up to right now:

Recently started the audiobook version of The Kingdom of Copper by Shannon Chakraborty, and really enjoying the 1001 Arabian Nights vibes (here's the [[books/Books I've read in 2024\|Books I've read in 2024]] so far). Working in [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbooks]] #5 (watercolour, A5) and #6 (mixed media, A6) concurrently. Playing around with making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Teresa_Watts), just for fun. Messing around with [[Voice chats with my ChatGPT UX mentor\|AI]] because I feel like I should be keeping up with these things. My [[letters/letters 9\|New Year resolutions]] have boiled down to "trust your gut" and it's actually working out pretty well so far.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
