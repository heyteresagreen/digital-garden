Here's what's in my stack currently:

## Analog writing and sketching

![../../assets/IMG_2365.jpeg|my notebook cover with 3 notebooks inside](/img/user/assets/IMG_2365.jpeg)

I'm still using my pocket (A6) sized Paper Republic leather cover - more on [[My notebook system\|my notebook system here]]. Inside I have:

* A plain notebook for **personal projects, diagrams, [[Sketchnotes\|sketchnotes]], to-dos and thoughts**. Currently using a plain Moleskine cahier notebook.
* A homemade notebook for **[[Morning Pages\|Morning Pages]]**, using old dot grid Leuchturm notebook paper. 
* A **[[Sketchbooks\|sketchbook]]** with smooth mixed media paper nice for **sketching and painting**. Currently using a homemade sketchbook.
* A light blue coloured Kaweco Sport **[[Fountain pens\|fountain pen]]** with sepia ink for writing and drawing (I also use various other art materials but this is the one always with the notebook)

I mostly use digital tools for work, but also have a Rhodia A5 notebook for work doodles, wireframes and mind maps.

## Digital writing

In 2025 I consolidated my various digital note taking tools to simplify a little, to allow for better cross linking, and play around with using locally run LLMs to "chat" with my notes. Obsidian is the tool I landed on, for its portability and extensibility (although these two things do conflict with each other a bit). The key thing for me is that it works across my devices, albeit not quite as smoothly as other options.

In Obsidian I have:

* **Work notes and to-dos**. I don't go as hardcore with this as some - I have a page to house notes for each of my work projects, plus a page for each week's to-do list. At work we use Jira for task management, so the tasks I keep in my Obsidian vault are more granular.
* **Fleeting notes, reading notes, and evergreen notes**. This is my zettlekasten, my personal digital garden of notes from things I've read, heard or thought about. Each evergreen note contains one idea and usually a bunch of references, (ideally) linked densely with other notes. The fleeting notes are mostly highlights from [[Reading things later\|articles I've saved to Instapaper]].
* **Website writing.** I publish some of my notes online, including [[Art\|Art]], [[Writing\|Writing]], [[Letters\|Letters]], and a smattering of my evergreen notes.  Here's [[My Obsidian workflow\|My Obsidian workflow]] for notes that I publish to [teresawatts.com](http://teresawatts.com)
### Previously
I used to use Notion for work and personal notes, and Bear my reading notes, fleeting notes and evergreen notes. I do still really like those apps, but it's nice to have everything together in Obsidian.

## Large Language Models (AI)
Strange that this one now has a place in my planning and writing stack. I still prefer to use AI as a [[books/book notes/Co-Intelligence Living and Working with AI\|co-intelligence]] as opposed to something I outsource writing to. I don't currently have any loyalty to a particular model other than using Gemini for work-related queries as we are given pro-level access to it. I don't usually have subscriptions to other LLM services unless I have something I particularly want to do with it; otherwise the free versions is enough to answer my needs.

## Digital sketching
**iPad Air + Apple Pencil + Procreate.** These are my tools of choice for digital painting, and I'm so used to Procreate that I've struggled to use anything else for sketching.
