Here's what I'm up to right now:

Getting back into the swing of the school year, this time with both kids in school - a struggle transitioning out of holiday mode. Also getting back into the swing of writing [[Morning Pages\|Morning Pages]], not daily and often not in the morning, but lately a necessity for stopping things bouncing around my head. Not doing art as much as I'd like to be. Trying to write a few thoughts about each [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|book I read this year]].

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
