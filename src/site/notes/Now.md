Here's what I'm up to right now:

Thinking a lot about designing the life that I want. Having more in-person catch-ups, which are filling me with so much energy and food for thought. Attempting the [One Week 100 People challenge](https://www.lizsteel.com/oneweek100people2025challenge/) (so far I've drawn 14 ðŸ˜…). Trying to be more intentional about the non-fiction [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|books]] and articles I read, and taking better notes. Playing with using AI to write code that I definitely could not do on my own. 

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
