A case study is a powerful storytelling tool. But writing them long after a project has finished, maybe when you’re applying for a new job, is hard. It’s easy to forget all the important details if you’re not keeping track of them in a centralised place. This is the same idea as [[notes/Don’t let good ideas go to waste\|Don’t let good ideas go to waste]], but specific to a project.

A project journal is one answer to this. For each project or initiative, keep a daily or milestone-based log. The personal journal format is key - details about how you felt, the mistakes you made and the tiny wins will help to create a more compelling story when the time comes to write a full case study, similar to how [[notes/Qualitative research tells a better story\|Qualitative research tells a better story]]

* The project journal is a valuable part of any work journal because it captures project-specific reflections and notes. Within each work journal, I have multiple project journals: dedicated pages for every defined project at the company. Some projects are short journals—no more than two weeks of entries—while others span months or years. 
* I have 15 minutes on my calendar for heads-down time to reflect on the day and journal what got done. I don't restrict myself from journaling during those times, but I have found that having that set time on the calendar helps me remain consistent.
* During scheduled journaling time, I'll capture what I remember from meetings, points that came up during my one-on-one conversations, or any specific design artifacts or elements I'm exploring at the time.
* The linear and personal format of a journal works well for translating into a case study because it focuses on your personal experience of the work. Your journal won't follow a stereotypical template of some romantic design process; it will follow the actual process you took through the work. It will be faithful to what you experienced as you worked on the project, making for a compelling case study.
