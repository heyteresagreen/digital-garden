Although I've done a fair bit of life drawing over the past year or so, I haven't had the chance to sketch a male model in a long time. It was great to have [Billy](https://www.instagram.com/brawlinbillyb/) to draw at [Sticc + Thicc](https://www.instagram.com/sticcandthiccsocialclub/) recently, although it was a challenge to switch gears from drawing the female form.
