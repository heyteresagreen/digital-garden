Here's what I'm up to right now:

Struggling with the lovely problem of having too many good books to read, some of which I need to return soon (here's the [[books/Books I've read in 2024\|Books I've read in 2024]] so far). Working in a couple of different [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbooks]] concurrently and attending monthly [[art/Life drawing in Charcoal\|life drawing sessions]]. School holiday shenanigans. Looking forward to a brand new shiny year. 

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
