This site is a little experiment into writing, Indie web and digital gardening. I used to make big splashy websites but this time I wanted to make it as simple and lean a writing and reading experience as possible. 

## Just the facts
The content of this site is written in  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and uses the [Obsidian Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) to publish to Github + Netlify (I have only a vague understanding of how that part works). Fonts are Georgia + Helvetica Neue (if you have it installed, Arial if you don't). Here's a bit about [[My Obsidian workflow\|My Obsidian workflow]].
