Finally got around to taking photos of the pieces I made in a 1:1 workshop with [Lien Nguyen Ceramics](https://liennguyenceramics.com/) The donut is officially the coolest thing I’ve ever thrown (with some help!). I’m so happy that I still have some muscle memory and so glad I got some time free to do this.
