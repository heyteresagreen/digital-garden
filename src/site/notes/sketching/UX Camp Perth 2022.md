I’ve had a long time between sketchnotes at conferences (although I have still been sketching!). Having two toddlers and a global pandemic can do that! But I was really determined to make the most of [UX Camp Perth](https://www.uxcamp.co/) this year, as an awesome local conference that I was lucky enough to get a last minute ticket to attend.

The [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format is always an interesting one, and I find it leads to an agenda of speakers and topics that you might not get in a more polished (and expensive) conference. That reduced formality really lends itself to greater connection and more fun!

The pitching was intense, with a huge 42 pitches. I thought I’d sketch the first few, and somehow ended up doing them all. There were so many great ideas that I hope people will hold onto if they didn’t get a chance to present on the day.
