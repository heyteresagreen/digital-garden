At the moment I have my notebooks and sketchbook together inside a [leather cover by Paper Republic](https://www.paper-republic.com/products/grand-voyageur-leather-journal?variant=46708728856917), so altogether it feels like one book. It's a bit hard to explain the system, so here's a video I made!

 Inside I have:

* A plain notebook for **personal projects, diagrams, [[Sketchnotes\|sketchnotes]], to-dos and thoughts**. Currently using the [Paper Republic plain refill](https://www.paper-republic.com/collections/write/products/notebook-refills) in the Pocket size.
* A loose folded sheet to log notable **moments from the week**, which I'm planning to bind together into a little book at the end of the year. It's just a loose sheet to avoid adding extra bulk and because it's a new thing I'm not sure I'll continue.
* A notebook for **[[Morning Pages\|Morning Pages]]**. Currently using up my stash of Field Notes and Moleskine Cahiers, as I'm getting through a couple each month. 
* A [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbook]] with smooth mixed media paper nice for **sketching and painting**. Currently using [Paper Republic drawing book](https://www.paper-republic.com/products/drawing-book) in the Pocket size.
