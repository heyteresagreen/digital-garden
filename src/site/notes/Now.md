Here's what I'm up to right now:

Just started reading The Bookbinder of Jericho by Pip Williams (here's the [[books/Books I've read in 2024\|Books I've read in 2024]] so far). Working in a couple of different [[Sketchbooks\|sketchbooks]] concurrently and attending monthly life drawing sessions. Experimenting with binding my own sketchbooks. Trying propagate my house plants, because my track record with new ones is not great and at least these are free. Working in different locations around the house depending on the weather (I am currently enjoying the sunshine in our courtyard). Thinking about writing more than actually writing. Volunteering on the committee for [UXCamp Boorloo 2024](https://uxcamp.au/) (which is sold out!).

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
