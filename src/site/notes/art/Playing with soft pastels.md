I bought a set of soft pastels a couple of years ago to make some abstract art. They’ve sat in their box, barely used until I felt like braving their messy, blunt nature recently. I still have no idea what I’m doing and feel like I need larger, more appropriate paper but it is pretty fun.

I wonder if I’m in love with the messy start of learning a new medium or art form, where I don’t have to be scared of being bad at it because it’s almost guaranteed. At least I didn’t spend any extra money on new materials this time!
