I have been trying to get into one of artist [Sue Hibbert's](https://www.suehibbertwatercolour.com/) classes for ages, and I think I'm not the only one - they always seem to sell out faster than I can organise myself. But this 2 hour watercolour workshop came up at the right time for me and I managed to make it in. 

Although I've been painting with watercolour for a while now, I'm mostly self-taught and somewhat chaotic (or intuitive maybe?). It was nice to work larger and in a more traditional style, whilst still embracing the unpredictability of watercolour and going where the painting wants to go. I could of course easily spot a bunch of things I admire about Sue's version that I didn't manage in mine, but looking at it on its own it doesn't feel so bad. The big round brush and fan brush were new to me and I struggled to get the lightness and restraint I'd like, something that will hopefully come with more practice working at this scale.

Afterwards I had to give the same reference image another go but at a more familiar size to me, in my A5 sized Alpha [[sketchbooks/Sketchbook 7\|Sketchbook 7]]. I still lost more white than I would have liked, but I think the colours were more successful.

Doing a little landscape like this made me want to do more, and the two quick sketches from photos I took on a recent trip helped me explore colour and value without spending too much time. 

I really want to get more serious about watercolour this year, and this workshop with Sue was a great way to kick that off!
