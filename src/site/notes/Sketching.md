I love the way that translating complex ideas into a visual format can make it more understandable and interesting to look at! I try to use sketches, diagrams and drawings both to figure things out for myself, and to explain things to others.

One practice I’ve found especially useful is creating sketchnotes during talks and meetings – I find it helps me listen more deeply in the moment, and to remember the most important points afterwards.
