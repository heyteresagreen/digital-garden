We multitask because we get bored easily, and require a certain level of stimulation to remain interested. If that isn’t coming from the task at hand (e.g. jogging which I find very boring), we supplement it with something else.

Unfortunately, it’s usually more efficient to [[notes/Do one thing at a time\|Do one thing at a time]]. However for some tasks (e.g. jogging) we can combine complementary activities to [[notes/Multitask better\|Multitask better]].
