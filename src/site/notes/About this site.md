This site is a little experiment into writing, Indieweb and digital gardening. You might want to [[Start here\|Start here]].

## Just the facts
This site is made with Jekyll, specifically the [Jekyll digital garden theme](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) (with some slight adjustments). It's published with GitHub and Netlify, don't ask me how it all works. Fonts are Georgia + Helvetica Neue (if you have it installed, Arial if you don't). I write notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and use [this plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) to publish to my Github. Here's a bit about [[My Obsidian workflow\|My Obsidian workflow]].

I'm starting again with the Digital Garden plugin for Obsidian.
