This was kind of a “junk” sketchbook, until I finished [[sketchbooks/Sketchbook 2\|Sketchbook 2]] and it became my main one. I didn’t have high hopes for this cheap mixed media sketchbook paper, but it was *almost* great, considering the price. It wasn’t just that it cost me less, but not feeling at all precious about “wasting” it was freeing and meant a lot more experimentation and risks, some of which paid off. I’d consider buying it again if it came in a smaller softcover version.

Some things I enjoyed trying out were permanent inks, my kids cheap watercolours, and sketching my travels, recent and long past.
