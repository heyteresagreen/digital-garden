This year, I've somehow gone from reading very few books to back up to pre-kid levels. I've put this down to actually getting consistently decent sleep, moving to a part-time job, and deliberately _not_ putting pressure on myself to read if I don't want to. 

Since reading _How to Take Smart Notes_ by Sönke Ahrens I've also really taken to the concept of "don't let good ideas go to waste", and have gone down the rabbithole of _zettlekasten_ and personal knowledge management (essentially taking notes as you read). I feel like this has transformed how I read non-fiction, and made me want to read a lot more as a result.

I've come to realise that being able read quickly is a superpower, and its one I'm planning to learn into more in 2023.
