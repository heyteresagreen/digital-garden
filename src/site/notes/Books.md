Also there's a love story. Does it all work together? Sort-of. But not my favourite.                                                                                                                                                              | 24 February 2026 |

The native people of the planet are considered primitive and inferior, and are horribly exploited, enslaved and brutalised to the point that they're forced to abandon their peaceful nature and retaliate. | 16 January 2026  |
