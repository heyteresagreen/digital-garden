Here's what I'm up to right now:

Playing around with sewing and crocheting clothing - nothing fancy or particularly polished, but it’s satisfying being able to fill a need by just making it myself. Making my spaces cosy and well-lit for winter. Not writing much because I’m struggling to bring myself to look at a computer screen once the work day is done. [[books/Books I've read in 2025\|Reading books]]. Painting a little.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first. I update it every few weeks or so.
