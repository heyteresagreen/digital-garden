I made it through 8 days of the [Peachtober](https://www.furrylittlepeach.com/peachtober) 30 day challenge for October, which is a record for me! This year I decided to play around with digital art app [HeavyPaint](https://www.heavypaint.com/), using my iPad. Such a strange and unpredictable app, it's both completely different to working with traditional media but also kind of similar.
