I’ve been trying out iOS focus (there’s a great comprehensive [rundown of how focus modes work on Hulry](https://hulry.com/ios-15-focus-mode/)). These different modes on Apple devices can be customised to change things like what kind of notifications get through, what apps or widgets display on the Home Screen, and a few other things to help you focus on what you’re doing. As much as that is possible when you’re surrounded by devices. Mine are synced across my phone, tablet and laptop.

I'm well aware that strategies like this for curbing phone is similar to organising all your junk rather than facing the fact that most of it should go in the bin. But I have found that this nudge has played a part in having a more considered approach to how I use my various screens.

Here’s what my setup looks like:

**In general**
I have learned from experience that having social media or work related apps on my phone is simply too much temptation for me to "just check quickly" at completely the wrong times. I use different devices for different activities, and try to set up my focus modes to support that. I only get push notifications from my calendar app, chat app and SMS because I don’t have anything else I need to pay attention to immediately. I like using art I’ve made as wallpapers, with different ones for different modes.

## Work
When I’m working, I have app notifications turned off and only my calendar widget with upcoming work meetings on my phone home screen. I don't have any work related apps on my phone in general, so I don't have a reason to be on my phone and try to keep it as boring as possible. This one switches on for my normal working hours, and switches off when I’m having a lunch break and can check back on any personal chats or emails.
## Fitness
I go to a gym at my local shops, so in this mode I have a Home Screen that has a widget to open up my exercise plan in Notion but also one to display my grocery shopping list and library app. This one is location based, so it triggers when I enter the area and off when I exit it.

**Swimming**
This is literally because I need to scan a QR code when arriving at my kids swimming lessons, and it’s easier to have a location based focus mode to have it on my Home Screen than remember to bring the card.
## Evening
After the kids are in bed, I have a precious hour or so to myself. I’m trying to gently nudge myself to paint or draw during this time, so my Lock Screen background is a painting I did, and I don’t have any widgets displaying upcoming calendar events so I’m not pulled into thinking about work.

## Do not disturb
Pretty straightforward, I used this default focus mode long before trying any other ones. Notifications are silenced and phone calls blocked aside from immediate family members. There are no apps on my Home Screen at all. The wallpaper is a photo of a sunset to remind me that it’s time to sleep. I know there’s a default sleep mode but this works for me.

This one turns on automatically at 9:30pm until 6am, although I can trigger it manually if I don’t want to be disturbed by my phone at another time. If I'm still on my phone, iPad or laptop when this mode switches on, it's my signal to pack up and get ready for bed.

So yes, all of the apps are technically still easily accessible if I really want to get to them. And I did have to do some of that decluttering initially to get to a place where this is useful. This is not so much digital minimalism as calm technology, being only what I need it to be in specific contexts and otherwise just getting out of my way and letting me get on with things.
